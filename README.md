## Weather App

I would say the UI/UX that I created is the best because it is clean and simple. Sometimes simplicity is really the best. This way the users would immediately see the details that they need upon opening the app. It is also user friendly because it doesn't require alot of navigation.

The code implemation follows the OOP principles and clean code. This allows the app to be manageable. Each function and classes have a specific function. The common codes can also can be reused by other classes.
